# aim5005_final

The assignment is submitted via this GitHub link. The folder includes the following documents,

1. a training dataset, Combined Data.csv;

2. a dataset used for the statement dataset prediction pipeline, sentiment_analysis.csv;

3. a Final project_short.py file, containing models with the best parameters, without randomized search details; [RECOMMEND running this file for testing]

4. a Final project.py file, containing the parameter tuning details, taking around 4 hours of running; 

5. a single statement prediction pipeline.py file, for single statement sentiment prediction, you can replace the statement with anything that interests you;

6. a Statement dataset prediction pipeline.py file, for a dataset of statements prediction, you can replace the statement dataset with anything that interests you;

7. two pkl files, which contain the best trained model for the sentiment analysis task, and the vectorizer used, necessary for the pipeline deployment;

8. and a final report document.

We recommend that Professor run the Final project_short.py file to check each model's performance instead of the Final project.py file, which will take a much longer time to run. Professor can also try out the pipeline if interested.

The folder enables the direct work of the pd.read_csv if downloaded to local devices. We used python3 before the file path to run the .py file through the Mac terminal.
