# aim5005_final

The assignment is submitted via this github link. The folder includes documents,:
    1. a training dataset, Combined Data.csv;
    2. a dataset used for the statement dataset prediction pipeline, sentiment_analysis.csv;
    3. a Final project_short.py file, containing models with the best parameters, without randomized search details; [RECOMMEND runing this file for testing]
    4. a Final project.py file, containing the parameter tuning details, taking around 4 hours of runing; 
    5. a Single statement prediction pipeline.py file, for single statement sentiment prediction, you can replace the statement with anything that interest you;
    6. a Statement dataset prediction pipeline.py file, for a dataset of statements prediction, you can replace the statement dataset with anything that inerest you;
    7. two .pkl file, which contains the best trained model for the sentiment analysis task, and the vectorizer used, necessary for the pipeline deployment;
    8. and, a final report document.

We recommend that professor run the Final project_short.py file to check each model performance instead of the Final project.py file, which will take a much longer time for it to run. Professor can also try out the pipeline if interested.

The folder enables the direct work of the pd.read_csv if downloaded to local devices. We used python3 to run the .py file through the Mac terminal.
